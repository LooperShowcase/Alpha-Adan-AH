    <h1>Products</h1>
    <p>Nike produces a wide range of sports equipment and apparel.
       Their first products were track running shoes. Nike Air Max is a line of shoes first released by Nike, Inc. in 1987.
      Additional product lines were introduced later, such as Air Huarache, which debuted in 1992. The most recent additions to their line are the Nike 6.0, Nike NYX, and Nike SB shoes, designed for skateboarding.
      Nike has recently introduced cricket shoes called Air Zoom Yorker, designed to be 30% lighter than their competitors'.
       In 2008, Nike introduced the Air Jordan XX3, a high-performance basketball shoe designed with the environment in mind.

      Nike's range of products include shoes, jerseys, shorts, cleats, baselayers, etc. for sports activities such as association football,basketball, track and field, combat sports, tennis, American football, athletics, golf, ice hockey, and cross training for men, women, and children. Nike also sells shoes for activities such as skateboarding, baseball, cycling, volleyball, wrestling, cheerleading, lacrosse, cricket, aquatic activities, auto racing, and other athletic and recreational uses. Nike recently teamed up with Apple Inc. to produce the Nike+ product that monitors a runner's performance via a radio device in the shoe that links to the iPod nano. While the product generates useful statistics, it has been criticized by researchers who were able to identify users' RFID devices from 60 feet (18 m) away using small, concealable intelligence motes in a wireless sensor network.</p>
